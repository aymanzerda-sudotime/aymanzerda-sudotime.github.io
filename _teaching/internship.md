## Description : 

During my internship at Techso Group, I had the opportunity to delve into the intriguing world of malware analysis. Over the course of the summer, I gained a wealth of knowledge and hands-on experience that shed light on the intricacies of this ever-evolving field. In this blog post,  I'll share the key takeaways and insights that shaped my understanding of malware analysis.

1-  Malware Analysis - A Tricky Endeavor : 

From day one, I realized that malware analysis is not for the faint of heart. It's a challenging and ever-evolving field where cybercriminals constantly adapt and innovate. To unravel their nefarious creations, I needed to arm myself with knowledge and tools.

2-  The Importance of Sandboxing : 

Handling malware samples requires a secure environment to prevent any unintended consequences. Sandboxing was the key to safely studying malware without compromising the integrity of the host system. Learning how to set up and use a sandbox was a crucial step in the process.

3- Safely Obtaining Malware Samples

4- Basic malware analysis : 

I learned the fundamentals of malware analysis, such as examining strings, inspecting Windows API calls, identifying packed malware, and uncovering host-based signatures. These skills provided me with insights into the malware's behavior and purpose.

5- Advanced malware analysis : 

Using tools like Cutter and x64dbg to dive deep into malware samples. This allowed me to control execution flow and defeat anti-analysis techniques, giving me a deeper understanding of how malware operates.

6- Assembly Language : 

Learning assembly language was a game-changer. It opened doors to advanced analysis methods, enabling me to dissect malware at the lowest level. Understanding assembly language was like deciphering the code of the digital underworld.

7- Real Word Analysis : 

The pinnacle of my internship was putting all these learned techniques to the test by conducting a full analysis of different malware samples from the wild. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that allowed me to apply my newfound expertise to real-world scenarios.
